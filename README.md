#Customer purchasing behavior prediction using Machine Learning Classification Techniques

Many of the sales and service provider companies while launching the new products, services and updated version of existing products needs to tout the related customers. While doing so they need to target their already existing customers. The behaviors of the customers give an intuition to the companies how to sell the products. This paper presents the comparative study different machine learning techniques applied to the problem of customer purchasing behavior prediction. Experiments have been done using supervised classification techniques of machine learning like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, Na√Øve Bayes,  SVM, Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Descent, ANN, AdaBoost, XgBoost, Dummy classifier, and some hybrid algorithms using stacking like SvmAda, RfAda and KnnSgd. Models are evaluated using cross validation technique. Furthermore, confusion matrix and roc curve is used to calculate the accuracy of the models. Finally, the best overall classifier obtained as hybrid classifier using ensemble stacking technique KnnSgd with accuracy of 92.42%.
